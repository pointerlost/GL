// glfwSwapBuffers swaps the front and back buffers.

// - The front buffer is what we currently see on the screen.
// - The back buffer is where we draw everything for the current frame (itâ€™s off-screen).

// After swapping:
// - The back buffer becomes the new front buffer and is displayed on the screen.
// - The old front buffer becomes the new back buffer.

// The new back buffer is not automatically cleared.
// We need to call glClear(...) to prepare it for the next frame.
